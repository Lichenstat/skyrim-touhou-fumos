This is where I work on touhou fumos for skyrim, some useful information down below

3d model scanning/original textures done by:
Renafox (most models) - https://sketchfab.com/kryik1023
scarletfumo (remilia model) - https://sketchfab.com/scarletfumo 

export model from blender as .obj
-Z forward
Y up
hitbox is (height, centered already)
27/2 = 13.5 (middle, centered around neck area of fumo)

use original mapped images and turn into .dds 2k textures
2048x2048 dxt1 for texture
2048x2048 (dxt5 for transparency layering, didn't use) for texture normal,
dessaturate (HSV) > levels (to bring out details) > filter generic normal 50 strength

https://winkingskeever.com/how-to-create-static-clutter-decor-meshes-with-only-nifskope/

using:
blender 3.0 with Nif plugin (to export model as .obj and attach required xml bits and pieces for later editing in NifSkope)
NifSkope (general Nif editing)
NifUtilsSuite (can generate collision/hitbox from a given mesh)
