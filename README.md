#.#.# Current Mod is currently the finished .zip mod file that should be downloaded and distributed amongst the Skyrim Data files if the mod is desired to be played with in game. Other than that the rest of this is a repository for the mods parts to either be updated or edited for later. If this repository or it's parts are desired to be used in another mod or some other project then you have my permission to do so, just dont forget to give credit where credit is due (that includes giving credit to the people below as well). What was done on the part of this mod was cleaning up the models, adding normals, porting to .nif, and implementation into Skyrim.
